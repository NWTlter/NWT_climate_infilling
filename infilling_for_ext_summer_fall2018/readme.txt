# R scripts written in order to update NWT LTER extended summer PCA analysis through 2017, at request of K. Suding for LTER ASM 2018. NWT LTER extended summer PCA analysis done for 2015 NWT LTER NSF renewal, by Emily Farrer and Lauren Hallett. R scripts created by Caitlin White (K. Suding graduate student). CTW followed infill methodology described in metadata for Saddle chart precipitation and Saddle chart temperature datasets. Scripts compare CWT infill results somewhat with other infilled Saddle temp and precip data sources.
# csv dataset of infilled Saddle precipitation and temperature, 1981-2014, used by E. Farrer in 2015 extended summer PCA analysis. Dataset provided by NWT LTER Data Manager Hope Humphries (CTW does not know how it was derived, who infilled).

# Contact caitlin.t.white@colorado.edu with questions. Use scripts however are helpful.
