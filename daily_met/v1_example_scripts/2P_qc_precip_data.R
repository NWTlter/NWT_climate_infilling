#' ### QC checks on precip pre gap-filling
#' 
#' Test report to:
#' 1. Read in NWT and neighbor station temperature datasets
#' 2. Check qualifying days don't overlap a non-NA day for NWT precip
#' 3. Check for breaks in time series
#' 4. Wide-format data for gap filling
#' 
#' All code will be displayed to show procedure and work out bugs
